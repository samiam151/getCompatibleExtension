#Get Compatible Audio Extension
## The Web Audio API Version of canPlayType() function

###What This Is
This little function I wrote helped me, so I figured it might help someone else as well. This is a simple function that, when run, returns the extension of most compatible audio codec for the browser in which it is run. For example, when run in Firefox, ".mp3" is returned.
